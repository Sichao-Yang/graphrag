this is a repo to test graphrag vs naive rag.

## graphRAG

follow [官方blog](https://microsoft.github.io/graphrag/) and [GraphRAG with Ollama](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Yu6JpLMWVo&ab_channel=FahdMirza)

notice, you need to replace the embedding_model file in the graphrag lib (this is a hack).

also notice, for local rag, this hack will fail. so more modification needs to be done.

you can run it from this [script](./graph_rag_run/run.py)

## naiveRAG

follow [this](./naive_rag/README.md)
